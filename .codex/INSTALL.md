# FinalRun for Codex

To use FinalRun with Codex, you need to manually install the skills.

## Manual Installation

Tell Codex:

```
Clone https://github.com/finalrun/finalrun to ~/.config/codex/plugins/finalrun, then add ~/.config/codex/plugins/finalrun/skills to your skills path.
```

Alternatively, you can symlink the skills directory if you have local access.

## Usage

Once installed, you can use skills like `generate-test` and `update-test` directly in your Codex environment.
